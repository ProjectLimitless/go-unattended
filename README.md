# go-unattended

A simple update package for Go

*Note: This is a Go implementation of the original [.NET Unattended package](https://github.com/ProjectLimitless/Unattended)*

## Documentation and Getting Started Guide

Available at the [Project Limitless Documentation site](https://docs.projectlimitless.io/unattended). The documentation is for
the .NET version of the package, but the same tutorial can be followed and used
with the sample code in the examples folder.
